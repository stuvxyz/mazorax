<p>I write blog in English to improve my English writing skills and sharing my experiences. This fun story explains why I should practise English every day.</p>

<p>The bilingual Cat - A mouse heard a cat meow and lurked in a burrow. Then it heard a dog bark. The mouse thought, “If there’s a dog around, the cat must have gone. Now I can come out.” The cat caught the mouse right away and thought contentedly, “How great it is to know a foreign language!”</p>
